# Hand-Gesture-based-Sketching-to-Image-Translation



ABSTRACT

This project presents an innovative system that utilizes hand gesture recognition and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to transform rough, gesture-based sketches into detailed images. The system employs MediaPipe for robust real-time hand tracking, enabling users to capture their gestures seamlessly and translate them into sketches on a digital canvas. By allowing users to draw with simple hand movements, the project democratizes digital art creation, making it accessible to individuals regardless of their artistic skills.
To enhance the quality of the generated images, the system incorporates GANs, which refine the initial sketches into high-quality outputs. This phase is critical in ensuring that the generated images are visually coherent and detailed, bridging the gap between rough sketches and polished artwork. The integration of deep learning techniques allows for continuous improvement in image generation, providing users with visually appealing results based on their input.
A user-friendly interface is developed using Streamlit, facilitating real-time interaction and immediate feedback. The interface allows users to engage with the system effortlessly, offering tools for sketching, image generation, and post-processing enhancements. By creating an intuitive platform that combines gesture-based inputs with advanced AI technologies, this project empowers users to express their creativity and explore new avenues in digital art, ultimately expanding the boundaries of interactive content creation.
