## Project Abstract
The report introduces a novel system for translating hand gesture-based sketches into high-quality images. This system leverages CVZone's HandTrackingModule for precise gesture recognition and Stable Diffusion for advanced image generation. The framework aims to provide an intuitive, touchless interface for artists and designers, enabling the creation of digital art through natural hand gestures. The system comprises three main components: real-time gesture recognition, digital sketch generation, and image synthesis. Implemented using Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and OpenCV, the system ensures robust performance and accurate outputs. The evaluation focuses on gesture recognition accuracy, image quality, and user satisfaction. The framework has potential applications in digital art, virtual design, and accessibility tools.
